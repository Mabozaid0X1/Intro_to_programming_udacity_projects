						   The sense of sight is rather weak in bears ,

						 Brown bears are large, heavy-bodied animals.
					  The brown bears have a hump-like muscle or snakes 
					  on their shoulders, 
					  and this muscle with the long claws of the brown bears
					   gives it a tremendous ability to dig.
					  And also have long curved arches, and are at the front 
					  ends longer than the back limbs.
					  They are at least 6 centimeters long.
